# SwaggerHub Linter Browser Extension

<img src="icon.png" height="150px" width="150px"/>

The SwaggerHub Browser Extension is a project which will be undertaken to allow users of the extension to apply their own rules to an API - this will be used to provide an external linting service to maintain the integrity of the SwaggerHub OpenAPI YAML file.

The way in which this would work is by the YAML file being exported and executed in the back-end before the Chrome extension will extract the relevant data and render the results in a web page.

Doing so will allow for the users of the extension to be able to enforce their own rules and ensure compliance as per 8x8's guidance. These REST API Standards and guidelines are detailed [here](https://confluence.8x8.com:8443/display/CCE/VCC+Rest+API+Standards).
The project will be phased gradually following milestones to be met to ensure that each component of the extension is compliant and can be accessed and utilised by its users.
